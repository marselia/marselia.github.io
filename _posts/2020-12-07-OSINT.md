One of the most used and important disciplines in the field of research and in computer security is obtaining information from open sources (OSINT, Open Source Intelligence).

The process followed when we research is almost always the same: access to the huge amount of information that gives open source, select and filter what interests us, process and analyze it, document it and draw conclusions.

In the professional field, this discipline is linked to the branches of security and journalism, although it can be useful for anyone who is interested in the world of investigation.
