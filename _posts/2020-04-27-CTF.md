Capture The Flag or CTF is the name given to challenges focused on computer security. They are very interesting 
because, in a fun way, anyone can learn about hacking.

Some types of CTFs that we can find are the following:
- Crypto: Hidden messages using encryption or encoding techniques
- Forensics: analysis of any kind of data
- Stego: multimedia that hides information inside
- PWN: vulnerabilities in servers
- Reversing: analysis of binary files
- Web: website vulnerabilities
- Programming: scripting
- OSINT: open source research
- Trivia: questions about computer security
- Misc: random challenges
