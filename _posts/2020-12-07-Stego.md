Steganography is the practice of hiding messages or information within other non-secret text or data and is usually embedded in images or audio. In the CTFs we must find the clues or flags that have been hidden.

There is a wide range of file types and methods for hiding files / data. Here we will show some of the techniques we can use to get the hidden information.

- First of all, see if there is a type of message that can be seen, such as morse or binary code.
- Check that the file extension is correct. Perhaps the file extension was intentionally changed.
- Look at the properties of the image.
- You can search in Google for keywords the type of file you have found and find a tool that you can use to get the flag.
- Use tools like "file", "strings", "exiftool", "pngcheck", "binwalk", "foremost", "imagemagick", "steghide", "hexedit", "xxd", "zsteg", "stegcracker "," stegsnow ". You can also help yourself with "eog", "grep", "md5hash", "cat", "katana".
- The famous Stegsolve (for example to perform XOR between images) or https://georgeom.net/StegOnline/image.
- Imagemagick.
- SmartDeblur to restore images.
- Image partition errors: volatibility.
- Use https://www.tineye.com/ to reverse search the image in the internet.
- Tesseract to convert an image to text.
- Audacity, DeepSound, Sonic Visualiser.
