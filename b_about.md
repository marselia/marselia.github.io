Hi, it's Celia and this is my first blog. I'm trying to improve my skills with 'self-education' projects and I'm always looking for more interesting things to learn.

For this reason, I have created my first blog.

This blog has been created as a compilation of my daily learning. My main idea is to write information related to technology but giving a greater emphasis to cybersecurity.
